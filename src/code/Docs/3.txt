1984 by George Orwell
It is a dystopian novel that was published in 1949. The novel is set in Airstrip One, a province of the superstate Oceania in a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public manipulation. The superstate and its residents are dictated by a political regime euphemistically named English Socialism, shortened to Ingsoc in Newspeak, the governmentâ€™s invented language. The superstate is under the control of the privileged elite of the Inner Party, a party and government that persecutes individualism and independent thinking as thoughtcrime, which is enforced by the Thought Police. The tyranny is overseen by Big Brother, the Party leader who enjoys an intense cult of personality but who may not even exist. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.
